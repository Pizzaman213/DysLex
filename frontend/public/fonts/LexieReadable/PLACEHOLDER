This is a placeholder. The LexieReadable-Regular.woff2 font file needs to be manually downloaded.

Lexie Readable is a font designed by Keith Bates at K-Type for readability,
particularly for readers with dyslexia. It is not freely redistributable as
a web font (woff2), so it cannot be downloaded automatically from a CDN.

To obtain Lexie Readable:

1. Visit https://www.k-type.com/fonts/lexie-readable/
2. Download the font according to the license terms
3. Convert to .woff2 format if needed (using a tool like https://cloudconvert.com/ttf-to-woff2)
4. Place the resulting file in this directory as: LexieReadable-Regular.woff2

Alternative free dyslexia-friendly fonts already included in this project:
- OpenDyslexic (in ../OpenDyslexic/)
- Atkinson Hyperlegible (in ../AtkinsonHyperlegible/)
